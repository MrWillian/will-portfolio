## Description

A personal portfolio is an essential tool for showcasing your skills, projects, and experiences to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. It serves as a centralized hub where you can highlight your accomplishments and demonstrate your capabilities.

This portfolio repository contains a web application built with React JS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The project is written in TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript that brings additional safety and tooling benefits.

The user interface is styled using styled-components, a CSS-in-JS library that allows you to write CSS code directly within your JavaScript components. This approach provides better component encapsulation and reusability.

Translation support is included, allowing users to switch between Portuguese and English versions of the portfolio. This enables you to reach a wider audience and tailor your content based on the viewer's preferred language.

The project also includes unit tests written with Jest, a JavaScript testing framework. These tests ensure the correctness and reliability of the codebase, giving you confidence in the functionality of your portfolio.

Feel free to explore the code, customize it according to your needs, and use it as a starting point for your own personal portfolio. Happy coding!

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
